#### How It Works:

The chatbot gives information to the user about any movie or actor. The program first asks for the movie or actor category then it searches the data in the movies/actor data files. If the data is found in the files then it displays the required data. If the data is not found in the data files then it gets i.e scrapes the data from google and then appends it to the data file for easy retrieval of data for the second time if the user enters the same search word. The project runs until the user enter 'q' to quit.
