1)    Hello my name is Aditya, I am learning python and AI at the Robogenius Academy. In this video, I am going to demonstrate how my project "Movie ChatBot" works.

2)    Movie ChatBot is a program that helps user to get the information about any movie/actor.

3)    This project involves the usage of web scraping and file handling which is done using
      Python.

4)    ChatBot searches the desired information on google and scrapes the results returned and neatly displays it to the user. It also stores the result in a csv file to make the same search faster

4)    Now let's take a look at the working model of the chatbot.
          ChatBot first asks us for the category that is movie/actor.
	  If we enter movie as category it would then ask us for the movie name.
	  After entering the movie name it would obtain the data from either the
	  file or scrape it from google. Then it would ask us for required data.
	  After entering the required data it would then present the data neatly.

5)    Now let's try the actor category.
	  It first asks us for the actor name.
	  It performs the same process for obtaining the data. Now it would ask us
	   the required data and then present it neatly.
